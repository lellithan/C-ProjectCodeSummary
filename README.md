# Live Project
## Introduction
The last two weeks of my time at The Tech Academy I participated in a simulated work environment. I worked with a team of junior developers in the program and helped build parts of a full scale MVC/MVVM Web Application using C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery. Working on a legacy codebase was a great opportunity to learn about fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features. Using the Azure DevOps methodology of Agile/Scrum our team was able to create small tasks out of large scale needs. I personally worked on several different "stories" as a part of my time on the project.

I gained varying degrees of skills, knowledge, and perspective working on this project. The work I did varied from front-end to back end work. Whether that was styling a View, updating the working database, or implementing functionlities desired. Over the two week sprint I was introduced to Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-Ups, Daily Updates, and Code Retrospectives. Between working on project management, team programming skills, and personal development; I am confident in my skills and abilities for future problems that are thrown my way!

Below you will see descriptions and navigation links to the stories I worked on/skills that I learned from them. Within this repository I also have full pages of the code I developed along with images, gifs, and snippets to compliment them.
